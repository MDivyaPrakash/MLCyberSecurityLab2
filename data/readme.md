   1. Download the validation and test datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rs68uH8Xqa4j6UxG53wzD0uyI8347dSq?usp=sharing) and store them under `data/` directory.
   2. The dataset contains images from YouTube Aligned Face Dataset. We retrieve 1283 individuals and split into validation and test datasets.
   3. bd_valid.h5 and bd_test.h5 contains validation and test images with sunglasses trigger respectively, that activates the backdoor for bd_net.h5
